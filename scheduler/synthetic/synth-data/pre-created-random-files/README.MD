# Pre created random files

The intention of this folder is to provide a set of pre created random files that can be used to test the various
parts of the scheduler.  
It is mainly intended to speed up development during the development of the the automated test gathering,
but they can be used instead of  generating new files if one wants to test the scheduler without having to wait 
for the files to be generated.
